# ShellKit
This shell toolkit is based on project alacritty and nushell.  
Because I want to make this shell completely portable, I modified the
source code to change their default config file location.  
It use starship as its prompt program (also the program's default config file location is modified).  
It also has some useful tools in the "bin" directory(some are modifield).
